# Security Pattern Catalog Maker

SPCatalogMaker is a toolset for creation and maintenance of well-organized catalogs of security patterns
(also misuse patterns, threats etc.) in the OWL (Web Ontology Language) and RDF (Resource Description Framework) formats.

SPCatalogMaker consists of:

* an ontology-driven model (Schema) that describes concepts and instances for depiction of the security-specific knowledge;
* a small application (Maker) to build an ontology and RDF dataset from a set of source files.

## Schema

Schema contains an ontology-driven model of security pattern, including context and security characteristics
(components and functions of computer systems, security concerns and threats).

* [OWL File](schema/SecurityPatternCatalogNaiveSchema.owl)

Extra information about Schema:

* [Common description](schema_description.pdf)
* [Components and functions](schema_functions_components.pdf)
* [Threats, attacks and vulnerabilities](schema_threats.pdf)
